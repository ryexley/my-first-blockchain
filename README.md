Simple node.js blockchain
==========================

This is a simple blockchain written in node.js that is based on [this tutorial](https://blog.liveedu.tv/how-to-create-your-own-cryptocurrency-blockchain-in-node-js/).

To test and verify the blockchain, run `npm run start` or `yarn run start`. Doing so will create a new instance of a blockchain, and create a random number of blocks and add them to the chain, and then verify the validity of the chain. The output can be seen in the terminal output.
